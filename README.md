Workspace of my Data and Business analysis projects conducted using a wide variety of tools


#Sales Analysis

The first project, sales analysis is a PowerBI dashboard created from a sales data. The data had various fields such as categories, sub-categories, product, location, sales and profit.

I created a dynamic automated dashboard on PowerBI Pro Service, where you can interact with the data. This means that if you click on any of the graph data, the other data on the dashboard changes to represent that data. (Note: The document I uploaded is a PDF File, hence you cannot interact with it here, for that you need my PowerBI workspace access).
Secondly, I have divided the report into various categories, the first one listing sales and profit by month. The next one is by categories and sub categories, giving you the option to drill down into the data and analyse it at a granular level. The 3rd one is a map data, giving out profit and sales by U.S. States and the 4th one lists down quantity as a product of categories and sub categories.

This dashboard helps the user identify the top performing states, the highest grossing products and categories and the season where the business booms.
