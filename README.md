The first project, sales analysis is a PowerBI dashboard created from a sales data. The data had various fields such as categories, sub-categories, product, location, sales and profit.

I created a dynamic automated dashboard on PowerBI Pro Service, where you can interact with the data. This means that if you click on any of the graph data, the other data on the dashboard changes to represent that data. (Note: The document I uploaded is a PDF File, hence you cannot interact with it here, for that you need my PowerBI workspace access).
Secondly, I have divided the report into various categories, the first one listing sales and profit by month. The next one is by categories and sub categories, giving you the option to drill down into the data and analyse it at a granular level. The 3rd one is a map data, giving out profit and sales by U.S. States and the 4th one lists down quantity as a product of categories and sub categories.

This dashboard helps the user identify the top performing states, the highest grossing products and categories and the season where the business booms.

Cricket is considered a religion in India, probably the largest. So it only seemed fitting to create a project on this. IPL, the Indian Premiere League is the world's largest league cricket tournament, held in India year after year. My analysis on this project ranged from analysing Batsmens', Bowlers' statistic over 10 years, the teams progress and the number of matches won/lost and the tosses as well.

This was a challenging project, with over 5 dataset related to each other, analysing the data and creating reports on them was a task which took me quite a while. The result is an amazing interactive dashboard uploaded on my PowerBI Pro workspace where you can analyse dozens of statistics with a single click. Click on a batsman score in a pie chart to see how he performed with respect to SR, Runs, 4s and 6s and more.

The project is still not complete since a dataset of this size needs justice by having more and more statistics and answering questions. I will try to update the project whenever possible.


**#Nike Performance Analysis - Excel, Tableau and PowerBI**

I recently worked on this short project, highlighting Nike's global performance across various markets and product segments. Finding the data was a hard task, since I could not find everything at a single source. Hence, I had to find data from various points, make it consistent and then run up visualisations.

Key Insights from this project: Nike sportswear is the best performing product, which recorded growth even during the pandemic, when other categories suffered losses. This can be linked to the fact that many non athletes starting doing regular exercises to stay fit in the pandemic.

North America is a stagnant market, showing signs of decline. Europe and China are key market, showing strong upward trend. North America still has the largest percentage of sales but europe is quickly catching to that number.

Wholesale is the best performing channel. Nike has consistently outperformed key competitors, Puma and Adidas, keeping the market leader position to itself
