This is the project space for MySQL projects.
The first project is fairly simpler, with just one dataset, tackling multiple questions on the customer - product preferences.

This project uses SQL concept such as GROUP BY, HAVING, Views, Joins within the same table and more.
The final questions is an introduction to market basket analysis where we can see what products are often bought together by the consumers.
